    "description": "<div>The <strong>N_I_T_R_O</strong> (<strong>n</strong>ewtype <strong>i</strong>njection <strong>t</strong>race <strong>r</strong>eformed <strong>o</strong>ldtype) System was a Psycommu system that granted Newtype abilities to Oldtype pilots. The greatest feature of the system was that when active, it caused the affected unit's drive system to emit what appeared to be blue flames. The system was originally developed in U.C. 0087 by the Titans, to allow the Psycho Gundam to operate more smoothly. However, the early n_i_t_r_o test units were deeply flawed, \"burning through\" their pilots and reducing them to a vegetative state after a single use. In U.C. 0094, an improved version of the n_i_t_r_o System was installed on the MSN-001X Gundam Delta Kai. While this version no longer \"burned through\" its pilot, prolonged use would cause the pilot's personality to become more violent and aggressive.</div>",
