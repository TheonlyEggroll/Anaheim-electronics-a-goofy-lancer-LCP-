    "description": "<div>A handheld firearm equipped with an energy condenser, it is common to the RX-0 series mobile suits. The power output of a single shot is the equivalent of 4 regular beam rifle shots at the expense of an entire E-pack. As such, a single shot is sufficient to destroy a mobile armor-class machine, and even stray particles from the fired shot have sufficient power to destroy a mobile suit, meaning a direct hit is not always required. The beams fired from the beam magnum are as hot as 10000°C and are surrounded by a field of plasma ranging from 3000°C to 7000°C—depending on how far away a particular area is from the actual beam. Five connected E-packs served as a single magazine for this weapon, and the magazine is also known as \"Magnum Bullets\". Up to two spare magazines can be stored on the Unicorn's rear skirt armor, meaning the beam magnum only has a maximum of 15 shots, causing it to have poor continuous battling capability. Additionally, the weapon can be too powerful for certain situations, limiting its use. When not in use, the beam magnum is stored on the backpack via a slot in the upper section.</div>",
